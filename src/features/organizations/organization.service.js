 * purge per tenant. Three covers a consultancy plus a client or two set up by
 * hand; anything past that should be an invitation, not a new tenant.
 *
 * It counts organizations that still exist: the cost being capped is live
 * tenants, and one that has been deleted has already been purged.

   * delete. This is meant to be the only place an organization is born;
   * `memberships_one_owner_uq`, not this method, arbitrates the owner seat.
   *
   * The cap is counted inside the same transaction with the founder's user
   * row locked. Count-then-insert without the lock is check-then-act, and four
   * parallel requests would all count two.
   *
   * Returns a full session for the new organization, minted through the same
   * choke point as login, so the founder needs no second call and no re-login
   * to use what they just made. The session is minted after the commit, since
   * `sessionFor` reads outside this transaction; if minting fails the
   * organization still exists, appears in the next login's `organizations`,
   * and `switch-org` is the way into it — a retry here would found a second.
